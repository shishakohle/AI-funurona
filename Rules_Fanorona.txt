Player white starts by chosing a token from his/her own team/color (typing in coordinate) and
places it on an empty field (.) by telling the program its direction, in which he/she wants to
move the first token (e.g. F4 NE). A token can only be moved to a neighboring, connecting field.
In order to capture the opponent's tokens there are two options:

	- Approaching:  moving own token towards one (or more) token from opponent - all tokens
		        on the continuation of this line will be captured
			e.g. F4 NE -> token capture: D2, C1

	- Widthdrawing: moving own token away from one (or more) token from opponent - all tokens
			behind the inital position will be captured
			e.g. F3  W -> token capture: G3

	- If Approaching and Widthdrawing is possioble (example Widthdrawing) the current Player 
	  can choose if he/she wants to approach or widthdraw

	- When the continuation-line of captured tokens is interrupted by an empty field or the
	  currents player tokens, the opponent's tokens behind will not be captured

If the current player is able to capture someone, he/she has to do so. Otherwise he/she can move
any other token, that allows a valid move. When the palyer was able to capture someone, and he/she
can capture another token, he/she can take another move. This is only allowed with the already
moved token. He/she has also the option to skip (SKIP) the move. While capturing as many tokens
as possible within one turn, the player is not allowed to visit a cell twice within one turn.
He/she also can't move in the same direction on two consecutive moves. Once you have captured all
tokens of your opponenty, you have won the game.
