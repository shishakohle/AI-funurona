You can type in one of the following comands to proceed:

1) Coordinate of the token you would like to move (e.g. F4) and a direction
   (e.g. NW). This allows you to move a token to a free postion.

2) If you are not sure about the rules, enter "Rules".

3) "Restart" will clear this game and allows you to start again.

4) If you don't want to continue playing, stop the game by entering "Quit".

5) "Skip" lets you skip a move, which however can never be the first one in
   your turn. 

You can now type in your next command!
